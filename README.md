Demonstration of the hangman game using Python💡
The hangman game is a word-guessing game where a player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. With each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" figure is drawn, representing the limited attempts before the player loses.

❓How to Create a Hangman Game in Python?
📌 First, we will ask for the name of the user. We will take the user input using the input() method. After execution, the input() method takes the input from the user and returns a string.
📌 Next, we will select a word and ask the user to start guessing the characters in the word.
📌 We will also define the maximum number of attempts the user can take.
📌 Now, we will use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user to guess the character until the attempts are exhausted.
📌 Inside the while loop, if the user guesses the correct character. We will include it in the response. Otherwise, we will notify the user that they made a mistake.
📌 If the user is able to guess all the characters of the word within the maximum number of attempts, they win the game.
📌 If the user exhausts all their attempts before guessing the entire word, they lose.


Here's a quick flowchart explaining the working of the hangman game .

Any modification in this game would be highly appreciated.
